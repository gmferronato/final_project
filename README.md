# final_project
This is my CS50P Final project

How it works:

This software asks the user to enter a country, a soccer team within the two major national leagues of that country, and finally a particular year. 
What it returns to the user as output is a pdf containing the team roster for the year chosen by the user. More specifically, it contains all the names of the players, their position within the team, and the team logo embedded in a half frame that takes the dominant color of the team logo and applies it to the frame itself.

Enjoy!
