# final_project
This is my CS50P Final project

How it works:

What this program does is quite simple: it prompts the user to enter a national league (among Italian, Spanish, German, English, and French only), then a team name (any team within first and second league of each allowed championship is valid), and finally a year. What it produces is a pdf file containing a table that includes all the players for the year in question, their role within the team, and the team logo embedded in a half frame that takes the dominant color of the team logo and applies it to the frame itself.

Enjoy!
